# SkinSymphony-Landing-Page
This project is a responsive landing page created for the Skilvul web development class as my first frontend project. The landing page is designed for a hypothetical skincare platform called "SkinSymphony," which helps users find harmonized skincare solutions tailored to their unique needs.
