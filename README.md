# SkinSymphony-Landing-Page
This project is a responsive landing page created for the Skilvul web development class as my first frontend project. The landing page is designed for a hypothetical skincare platform called "SkinSymphony," which helps users find harmonized skincare solutions tailored to their unique needs.

Key Features:
- Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
- Sectioned Content: Includes sections for an introduction, features, and user engagement (e.g., newsletter sign-up and contact information).
- Modern Styling: Utilizes clean, modern design principles with a consistent color scheme.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The project showcases fundamental frontend development skills, including semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript interactivity.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
